# numerote_core

This is a package I created while developing [Numerote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/numerote-word-count-note/id1507853252), a simple notepad app written with Flutter.

This package contains the core data logic for the app, including a SQLite adapter with was created with a fantastic package called [moor](https://moor.simonbinder.eu/) - that I highly recommend.

I haven't open sourced the code for the app itself(and probably won't), but I also created another package([numerote_migrator](https://github.com/ClimbingSilverTA/numerote_migrator)) to migrate the data from v1.0 of the app.
